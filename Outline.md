## Steps to Design Cirriculum
 1. Determine necessary skills acquired
 2. Figure out the means through which skills are acquired
 3. Reach out to potential teaching team
 4. Bring ideas to robo profs
 5. Talk to cirriculum faculty (Rob)

## Need to Keep in Mind
Autonomy --> students have choice in what they do (ie: pick project, pick problem sets, pick presentation style)

Competency --> scaffolding that boosts confidence

Relatedness --> relate subject matter to other classes + beyond this class, autonomy helps here
